# wms
A web-native and LLM-enhanced app for organizing and finding your sh*t!

As we accumulate stuff, many of us face the same challenges: We frantically place our items in bins, we place the bins in long-term storage and then we forget two important pieces of information:

1) The contents of each bin
2) In which bin we've placed some individual item that we are looking for. 

The intention behind WMS is two-fold:

1) Visibility into the contents of our storage units, which are heavily inconvenient to manually search through.
2) Guidance on where to find individual items. 

1 can be accomplished through a simple QR-code system. I intend to accomplish 2 with AI-enablement.
