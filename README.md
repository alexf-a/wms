# wms
A web-native app for organizing and finding your sh*t!

Personal storage comes with two major pain points:
1) Storage unit transparency: We are unsure what items exist in individual units of storage (such as bins, lockers, sheds, etc.)
2) Individual item location: We are unsure of the whereabouts of particular items. 

WMS seeks to address both pain-points:
1) Storage unit transparency is increased through a simple digital inventory system
2) Items are located through advanced search capabilities, using image and natural language inputs for user convenience.
