# Caddyfile for local HTTPS development with Caddy reverse proxy
#
# This configuration enables testing the WMS app in production mode (DEBUG=False)
# with HTTPS locally using Caddy's automatic TLS with self-signed certificates.
#
# Uses mDNS (.local domain) for automatic network discovery.
# Works on both desktop and mobile devices without IP configuration.
#
# Environment variables required:
#   DOMAIN - Your Mac's mDNS hostname (e.g., alexs-macbook-pro.local)
#
# Access points:
#   https://{$DOMAIN}:8443  - Works on desktop AND mobile
#   http://{$DOMAIN}:8080   - Redirects to HTTPS

# Global options - disable automatic HTTPS redirects on non-standard ports
{
	auto_https disable_redirects
}

# HTTPS endpoint - single domain using Caddy's internal CA
https://{$DOMAIN}:8443 {
	reverse_proxy web:8000 {
		header_up X-Forwarded-Proto https
		header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
		header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
	}
	
	# Let Caddy auto-generate certificate for the domain
	tls internal
}

# HTTP to HTTPS redirect
http://{$DOMAIN}:8080 {
	redir https://{$DOMAIN}:8443{uri} permanent
}
