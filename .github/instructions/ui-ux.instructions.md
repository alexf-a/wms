# UI/UX Design Guidelines

## Design System

WMS follows **Google's Material 3 (M3) Design System** for a modern, cohesive user interface.

The Table of Contents for the Figma M3 Design Kit can be found at https://www.figma.com/design/h9iZkAZgIKmfP2AM8zHJyb/Material-3-Design-Kit--Community-?node-id=55879-3580

Less content is more. Pursue sleekness and simplicity.

## Color Scheme

Primary: Green #50a46c
Secondary: Neutral Gray #605D64
Tertiary: Soft Teal #3D8B83

## Buttons
- Keep all button text minimal
- Prefer icons to text

## UI/UX Coding Process

Front-end web dev work should see consistency across the app and parsimony in CSS styles. Please consult (and perhaps extend) existing styles before making changes, to ensure consistency and maximize reusability.


### UI/UX Figma Workflow
The creation of new HTML/CSS content should be inspired by Figma templates. The Figma-based UI/UX collaborative workflow will work as follows:

1. I provide a template or general description and request a design implementation. This might be for a page, multiple pages or a portion of a page.
2. You break the design down into individual component such as buttons, menus, text fields, etc. 
3. You consult the Figma M3 Design Kit Table of Contents for the component categories. 
4. You select one component category at a time, and follow the below process:
    a. You request the M3 Material Design Kit Figma URL for the component catory you have selected.
    b. I provide the Figma URL as well as general guidance for how I want the component to look and function.
    c. You get the Figma page meta-data.
    d. You use the Figma page meta-data to select a specific Figma component that fits my guidance..
    e. You extract the styles from that Figma component. 
    f. You implement the component.
