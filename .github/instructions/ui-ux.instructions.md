# UI/UX Design Guidelines

## Design System

WMS follows **Google's Material 3 (M3) Design System** for a modern, cohesive user interface.

The Table of Contents for the Figma M3 Design Kit can be found at https://www.figma.com/design/h9iZkAZgIKmfP2AM8zHJyb/Material-3-Design-Kit--Community-?node-id=55879-3580

## Color Scheme

Primary: Green #50a46c
Secondary: Neutral Gray #605D64
Tertiary: Soft Teal #3D8B83

## UI/UX Workflow
The UI/UX collaborative workflow will be based off interaction with Figma.

The workflow is as follows:

1. I provide a template or general description and request a design implementation. This might be for a page, multiple pages or a portion of a page.
2. You break the design down into individual component such as buttons, menus, text fields, etc. 
3. You consult the Figma M3 Design Kit Table of Contents for the component categories. 
4. You select one component category at a time, and follow the below process:
    a. You request the M3 Material Design Kit Figma URL for the component catory you have selected.
    b. I provide the Figma URL as well as general guidance for how I want the component to look and function.
    c. You get the Figma page meta-data.
    d. You use the Figma page meta-data to select a specific Figma component that fits my guidance..
    e. You extract the styles from that Figma component. 
    f. You implement the component.
